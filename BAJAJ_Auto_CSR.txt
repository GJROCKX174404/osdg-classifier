Bajaj Auto Limited
Annual Report on CSR activities
1.  Brief outline of Company™s CSR Policy, including overview of projects or programmes 
proposed to be undertaken and a reference to the web-link to the CSR Policy and projects 
or programmes. 
 Introduction
 The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities of Bajaj Group are guided by the vision and 
philosophy of its Founder, late Jamnalal Bajaj, who embodied the concept of Trusteeship in business 

and common good, and laid the foundation for ethical, value-based and transparent functioning. 
 Bajaj Group, thus, took the unprecedented step of using business to serve society over a  
century ago. Jamnalal Bajaj strongly believed that ﬁcommon good was more important than 

individual gainﬂ. His philosophy has stood the test of time as it has been successfully taken forward 

by the succeeding generations, i.e., firstly by his sons, Kamalnayan Bajaj and Ramkrishna Bajaj, and 

now spearheaded by his grandson Rahul Bajaj. This philanthropic approach has taken the Group to 

higher levels of success and respect. 
 Though the Group stands tall in the corporate world, with high ranking in terms of market 
capitalisation, turnover, profits, range of products and services and various other parameters,  

Bajaj Group believes that the true and full measure of growth, success and progress lies beyond 

balance sheets or conventional economic indices. It is best reflected in the difference that business 

and industry make to the lives of people. Through its social investments, Bajaj Group addresses 

the needs of communities residing in the vicinity of its facilities, taking sustainable initiatives in the 

areas of health, education, environment conservation, infrastructure and community development, 

and response to natural calamities. 
 For society, however, Bajaj is more than a corporate identity. It is a catalyst for social empowerment. 
It is the reason behind the smile that lights up a million faces. Its goodwill resonates in the two 

simple words that live in the collective consciousness of Indians-Hamara Bajaj.
