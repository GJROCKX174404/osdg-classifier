1.
 A. brief outline of the company’s CSR policy, including overview of projects or programs proposed to be undertaken and 
a reference to the we-link to the CSR policy and projects or programs.
 Corporate Social Responsibility, though obligatory and mandatory, has now transcended to such a convincing belief that many 
Corporates feel, for their business to be successful the communities around also have to prosper. It ought to be a mutually 

beneficial symbiotic co-existence. It is important to earn the trust and loyalty of the communities within the proximity of bus
iness 
operations to take forward one’s own goals.
 This is more apt for a mining company like Coal India Limited.

 In India, coal deposits occur in places that are thickly inhabited. If this prime commercial energy fuel has to be accessed fo
r 
greater national development goals, it is inevitable that people are relocated from their original habitat. But, Coal India res
ponds 
in a responsive and responsible manner to the rights of these people. Loyalty is given to the values that a company stands for 
and 
Coal India values impacting the quality of lives of communities around its mining areas.
 Coal India is of firm conviction elevating the living standards of affected people is as important as attaining its business g
oals.
