6. In case company has failed to spend the two percent of the average net proﬁt for the last three ﬁnancial years or any 
part thereof, the reasons for not spending the amount. 
 We have spent 1.2% of our Net Proﬁt as part of our CSR in the reporting period. As a responsible bank, we have approached the 
mandatory requirements of CSR spend positively by utilizing the reporting year to lay a foundation on which to build and scale 

future projects and partnerships. We are currently in the process of evaluating strategic avenues for CSR expenditure in order 
to 
deliver optimal impact. In the years to come, we will further augment our effort to meet the targeted CSR spends.
